New customers retention is a big concern for almost every SaaS provider. To engage new customers you need to help them reach *"Aha!"* moment faster.

One of the proven tactics here is to offer a *Guided Product Tour*.

Numerous libraries allow you to create own guided product tours and onboard customers quickly. But today we want to present you another one - [GuideChimp](https://www.labs64.com/guidechimp/){:target="_blank"} - a lightweight and extensible library that allows creating guided tours easily by every user, even inexperienced in web development.

## Why is GuideChimp different?

Although it does the same job as other Guided Tour libraries, GuideChimp has a number of advantages:
* It's easy to learn, requires minimum upfront knowledge.
* Compatible with the modern asynchronous & single page web applications written in React, Angular, Vue.js and other web frameworks.
* Extensible by plugins - a number of built-in plugins available or you can contribute by developing your own.
* Minimum overhead and fast response by deferred DOM elements assignment (lazy-loading).
* Multi-page tour capabilities.
* Interactive tours possible by adding event listeners and callbacks.
* ...any many other useful [features](https://www.labs64.com/guidechimp/#features){:target="_blank"}

GuideChimp is the most up-to-date and well-maintained library as of today. It is available under *Apache 2.0 License*.

## How To Start

### Install

There are multiple options available how you can include GuideChimp in your application. Choose the one that fits best to your technology stack:
* HTML Element declaration
* Node.js/npm Module
* ES6 Module

Use below example to add GuideChimp using HTML &lt;head&gt; elements:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- GuideChimp -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/guidechimp@2/dist/guidechimp.min.js"></script>	 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/guidechimp@2/dist/guidechimp.min.css">
<!-- GuideChimp - GA plugin -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/guidechimp@2/dist/plugins/googleAnalytics.js"></script>     
{% endhighlight %}

### Configure

Below is the minimal configuration needed to create tour definition for your web app.

{% highlight javascript %}
var tour = [
  {
    element: '#id1',
    title: 'Step 1',
    description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.',
  },
  {
    element: '#id2',
    title: 'Step 2',
    description: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.',
  },
];
{% endhighlight %}

Every tour step can be associated with particular element on the page by specifying its CSS selector in `element` attribute.

As a next, you need to initialize GuideChimp object and define what action or event will start the tour. In this example we hook to the click on elemnt with id `startTour` (assuming such element is present on your page):

{% highlight javascript %}
var guideChimp = new GuideChimp(tour);
document.getElementById('startTour').onclick = function() {
  guideChimp.start();
};
{% endhighlight %}

That's all you need to get your first tour ready: by clicking on the element with id `startTour` you will see GuideChimp in action.
