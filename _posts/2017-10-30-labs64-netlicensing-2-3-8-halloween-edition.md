Major changes in this release:

* **NetLicensing Agent** is delivered now with extended security, which makes offline licensing resistant against data manipulation by using a digital signature.
*NetLicensing Agent 2.3.8-ALPHA2* can be shared with our beta testers on request.

* We revisited all NetLicensing **Client Libraries** to be inline with the latest available [RESTful API](https://netlicensing.io/wiki/restful-api).

* **[Pay-per-Use](https://netlicensing.io/wiki/pay-per-use)** Licensing Model got small improvements for better support of post-account scenario.

* MyCommerce **automatic renewal** feature is fully supported by NetLicensing now.

* Also, we've implemented many improvements and bug fixes across all NetLicensing components: *Core*, *Management Console*, *Shop*, *Gateway*, *Client Libraries*, and *Documentation*.
