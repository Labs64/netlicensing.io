However, some studies were able to prove that productivity was decreased by 50% compared to working in the office. The main reason why this issue occurred is that many employees did not have the tools to work with. Thus, SaaS solutions have a strong advantage compare to their on-premise competitors.


On-premise applications, in order to remain competitive in the market, have several ways to transform their current approach to a more hybrid one. The initiative that would be more beneficial is the deployment of some compute power from the desktop to the could. This would allow the desktop application to become more efficient also on less powerful laptops. However, the challenge with this approach is that it takes a considerable amount of time for implementation and development and many are the on-premise companies that are facing issues since they aren’t able to support their customers.
