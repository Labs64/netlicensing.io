All IT Professionals have their own software preferences for email, antivirus, operating system and office suites and they will always tell you why their choice is the right one. Whilst all options have different pros and cons you may from time to time want to change the software used often when there is a change of management and this can be a costly exercise, both in the time taken to migrate to the new software as well the cost of licensing.

However, in some cases, it is not always necessary to purchase a completely new license. Instead, a competitive upgrade license may be offered. A competitive upgrade license is where you pay to upgrade your software but also change the software that you are using. For example; you want to change the antivirus software that you use on your network but are reluctant to do so as you have an existing license agreement and you want to avoid hefty new license fees.

This is where a competitive license comes in rather than having to cancel your existing license, losing any money that you may have paid out for it and then having to pay the full cost of a brand new piece of software you can pay to upgrade to the new software. It works in a similar way to when you pay to upgrade an existing installation except that instead of upgrading your existing software you upgrade to something completely different.

There are clearly huge advantages to this; for one thing, you will almost certainly save money. You are given a greater choice of software without having to concern yourself with expensive migration costs and it encourages manufacturers to keep the cost of their products lower and improve their service so as to encourage customers to stay.

The next time you are looking to upgrade or change the software you use, make sure you investigate whether a competitive upgrade license is available.
