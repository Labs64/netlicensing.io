## Labs64 NetLicensing is one of the first to join new Stripe partner program

Most people today don’t know that only three percent of GDP is online. That’s why we’re excited to join the Stripe Partner Program to increase internet commerce and help companies start, run, and scale their businesses.

By <a title="Stripe Partner Program" href="#" rel="nofollow">joining the program</a>, our mutual customers will now benefit from the combination of Labs64 NetLicensing services with Stripe’s seamless payments platform.

Labs64 NetLicensing is a first-class solution in the Licensing-as-a-Service sector. Based on open standards, it provides a cost-effective, integrated and scalable licensing platform for your software.

We believe that removing barriers to online commerce helps more new businesses get started, levels the playing field, and increases economic output and trade around the world. Together with Stripe, our mission is to bring more commerce online and increase the GDP of the internet.
