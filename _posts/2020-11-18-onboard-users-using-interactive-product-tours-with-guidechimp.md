### How to enable GuideChimp tours

So, let's see, how you can start using GuideChimp in a few simple steps.

#### **Install library**

There are numerous [ways](https://github.com/Labs64/GuideChimp/wiki/Install){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener nofollow"} how you can install GuideChimp library:

- CDN
- Node.js / npm module
- ES6 module
- manual installation

We will be using Node.js / npm method in this guide:

Execute following command in your Node.js environment:
```shell
> npm install guidechimp
```

or simply add the dependency to your `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "guidechimp": "x.y.z"
}
```

#### **Prepare HTML page**

GuideChimp is using DOM elements on your website to highlight these and show tooltips. You need to identify website visuals that need to be highlighted.

Use CSS selectors to identify these elements. You can use this article to see [how to verify CSS selector](/blog/2020/10/12/validate-css-selectors/).

HTML snippet example with the link element and `"id"` property set:
```html
<a href="#" id="guidechimp-demo" class="NL_button button_main NL_light_btn" role="button">
    <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>Demo Tour
</a>
```

#### **Define tour steps**

Now you need to define guided tour steps using the elements data we prepared and collected in the previous section.
GuideChimp supports [two ways](https://github.com/Labs64/GuideChimp/wiki/Configure#step-definition){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener nofollow"} of how the tour steps can be defined: *HTML Attributes* and *JavaScript Object*.

In this tutorial we will be using JS method.รถ

Create `tourGuideChimp` JS variable and assign an array of the steps:
```javascript
var tourGuideChimp = [
    {
        element: '#guidechimp-demo',
        title: 'GuideChimp Demo',
        description: 'See GuideChimp in action, right here & now, on your screen.'
    }
];
```

#### **Start guided tour**

Now we need to trigger GuideChimp tour start, e.g. on element click, page open or any other event on the website.

```javascript
// initialize GuideChimp class
var guideChimp = GuideChimp(tourGuideChimp);
document.querySelector('#guidechimp-demo').onclick = function () {
    // start tour via 'onclick' event
    guideChimp.start();
};
```

### Showtime

That's all and very easy! The tour is ready to go and show your customers all the best sides of your webapp!
